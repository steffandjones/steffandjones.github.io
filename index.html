      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="center">

        <strong>I graduated from Harvard University in May 2025 with an SB degree in Mechanical Engineering.</strong> While at Harvard, I was a committed member of the varsity Track and Field team, training upwards of 25 hours a week, for an entire 4 years, all in hopes of shaving just a few seconds off my personal best. Alongside training, I worked as the <strong>Head Course Assistant for ES183: Introduction to Heat Transfer</strong>, where I dedicated 10 hours per week, hosting office hours, grading quizzes, and writing up solutions to the weekly problem sets. Finally, I was a member of 2 clubs: the <strong>Harvard Automotive Society</strong>, working on the University’s first FSAE car, and the <strong>Harvard Rocket Propulsion Group</strong>, helping build the Ivy League's first contemporary liquid bi-propellant rocket..
        
        <br><br> 
        
        Outside of academics, <strong>I have competed and trained in Track and Field for over a decade.</strong> I began with cross country, and then shifted to the shorter sprints as I grew older. My main event is now the <strong>400m, where I have run 46.7s</strong>, and have represented my country internationally on numerous occasions. The 400m has taught me a great deal about <strong>discipline, time management, and remaining optimistic when things don’t go as planned - skills that have greatly supported me throughout my academic journey.</strong>
        
        	<br><br>
        
        One of the greatest parts of studying at Harvard, aside from the amazing people I have had the privilege of meeting, has been the freedom in course selection. While I majored in Mechanical Engineering, I had the opportunity to explore other academic areas that I otherwise would never have considered. I was fortunate to have taken courses in <strong>Python, Electrical Engineering, and most notably, Semiconductors, which I consider to be one of the most intellectually rewarding subjects I encountered.</strong> This freedom extended outside of engineering, as well; over my four years, I explored broader topics like <strong>Ancient Greek Mythology, Chinese Philosophy, and even Irish Folklore,</strong> to name a few. 
        
        	<br><br>
        
        Outside of college, I'm an <strong>avid music lover, recreational tennis player, and self-proclaimed social butterfly.</strong> I enjoy spending time with friends and family, going to concerts, playing sports, or simply relaxing in the city. Moving from the countryside to the amazing city of Boston has given me the chance to explore, grow, and discover what I truly enjoy - and <strong>I’ll always be grateful for my time at Harvard.</strong>
