        <!-- Main description -->
        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
          
          For my senior thesis, I co-led the aerodynamic design and full fabrication of the front wing for Harvard’s inaugural Formula SAE racecar. 
          Unlike typical flat-plate student designs, our wing incorporated complex multi-element geometry <strong>inspired by Formula 1</strong>, including three custom-curved profiles and sculpted endplates. 
          This approach enabled <strong>greater downforce and improved flow conditioning toward the undertray</strong> - something most baseline designs overlook.

          <br><br>

          We developed the entire system from scratch using SolidWorks for CAD modeling, SimScale for CFD validation, and COMSOL to simulate material stress and flow interactions across the wing surfaces. 
          Multiple iterations were prototyped and evaluated to balance aerodynamic <strong>performance, manufacturability, and weight.</strong>

          <br><br>

          The build phase pushed us into unfamiliar and often unsupported territory. The foam cores were CNC-machined using a multi-pass, 3-step strategy that we developed entirely ourselves - 
          a process <strong>not typically taught at the undergraduate level</strong> and essential for capturing our wing’s aggressive curvature and high fidelity.

          <br><br>

          We also had to figure out composite layup and bonding largely independently. None of the faculty had experience with carbon fiber, and the university lacked proper facilities for cutting or curing composite parts. 
          We adapted as best we could - using vacuum bagging for flat and lightly contoured sections, and leaving the complex curved surfaces raw. 
          While this limited our ability to fully assemble the wing, it was a calculated trade-off to avoid damaging the high-fidelity geometry. 
          With better facilities, we would outsource or automate this final layup step. Additionally, we had no safe environment for trimming carbon fiber, so final fitting and bonding was postponed.

          <br><br>

          Despite the challenges, the project was an <strong>enormous technical and personal learning experience.</strong> We built a highly engineered aero system <strong>from scratch</strong>, and in doing so, developed skills in simulation workflows, 
          CNC toolpath design, composite manufacturing, and cross-disciplinary problem solving.
