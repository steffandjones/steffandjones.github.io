        <!-- Main description -->
        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
          This was my final project for my <strong>Intro to Electrical Engineering class</strong>. The goal was to build a rotating 1D LED strip that could render images in midair using persistence of vision. The inspiration came from a similar display I saw at a Kung Fu Tea shop, displaying their delicious boba tea - and I wanted to build one entirely from scratch.

          <br><br>

          The system used an Arduino microcontroller to map any uploaded image to <strong>timed RGB flashes as the strip spun.</strong> My team and I wrote custom code to calculate the <strong>correct color and timing based on the LED’s radial position and rotation speed,</strong> depending on the requested image.

          <br><br>

          Fabrication included <strong>3D printing, soldering, breadboarding</strong>, and integrating a rechargeable battery (and the breadboard) directly onto the rotating body to avoid slip rings or tangling wires. I also designed a protective case for the electronics and motor(to avoid any accidents) and worked towards finding the correct current input to achieve our desired RPM.

          <br><br>

          Through this project, I learned how to synchronize fast hardware timing with mechanical systems, design for motion, and debug both hardware and code under a 3 week time constraint. It was a creatively fulfilling challenge that <strong>brought together all aspects of electrical and mechanical engineering.</strong> It was fun to be able to display any image we were asked to, from the Harvard crest to all sorts of different emojis!
