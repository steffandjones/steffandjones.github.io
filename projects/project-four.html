        <h2>My Internships</h2>

        <!-- Short blurb -->
        <p class="justify">
          During my time at Alesi Surgical Ltd., I worked as a mechanical engineering intern supporting product testing, design optimization, and rapid prototyping for next-generation laparoscopic devices.

        <!-- Main description -->
        <p style="margin-top: 2rem; text-align: justify;">
          Alesi Surgical is a medical device company based in Cardiff, Wales, focused on developing innovative technologies to improve surgical outcomes. Their flagship product, Ultravision™, is a pioneering system used in laparoscopic surgeries to manage surgical smoke and maintain clear visibility. As a mechanical engineering intern at Alesi Surgical, I worked closely with the engineering team to support product testing, design refinement, and quality improvement efforts across multiple devices.
            <br><br>
          One of my main responsibilities was evaluating and improving the structural rigidity of a laparoscopic instrument in response to feedback from surgeons. Working alongside two other engineers, I conducted a series of mechanical tests using an Instron machine to quantify flexural strength across various rod materials. After gathering performance data, I compiled results into Excel spreadsheets, generated visualizations, and documented findings in formal reports. Our analysis ultimately influenced which material was selected for use in the final production model.
            <br><br>
          Midway through my internship, I was asked to support the Ultravision team with a separate challenge: redesigning their internal test rig to reduce the time required to verify each device. I was given full creative control over the design process, using SolidWorks to model and iterate multiple prototypes. After several rounds of 3D printing and refinement, I delivered a final version that significantly streamlined the testing workflow. In addition to these projects, I also helped maintain internal documentation by checking and updating Bills of Materials (BOMs). I thoroughly enjoyed working across disciplines and contributing to both hands-on testing and product development.
