          Designed and built a balsa wood bridge optimized for load-bearing strength using a tension-based string system, and a dense network of cross-bracing and trusses. <em>Images and final documentation below.</em>

        <!-- Main description -->
        <p class="center">
          As a <strong>final project for ES120 (Introduction to Structural Mechanics, taught by Professor Vlassak)</strong>, our team was challenged to design and build a lightweight bridge capable of supporting a large load relative to its own weight. We were restricted to using only thin balsa wood strips and string, making <strong>strength-to-weight ratio the primary design goal</strong>.
          
          <br><br>
          
          Our bridge adopted a highly triangular profile, drawing structural inspiration from <strong>Pratt and Howe truss systems</strong>. We integrated a dense <strong>network of cross-bracing to maximize load distribution and stiffness throughout the frame</strong>. To address the tendency for the bridge tips to lift under central loading (a classic bending moment scenario), we added <strong>two tensioned strings running from end to end. These acted as ties, counteracting upward deflection and keeping the structure in equilibrium under stress.</strong>
          
          <br><br>
          
          The competition involved suspending a large Home Depot bucket from the center of the bridge and gradually filling it with water. <strong>Our bridge handled over 20 kg (approximately 44 lbs) of water with ease</strong>, so we began testing its limits more directly. One by one, we took turns hanging from the structure. I weigh around 150 lbs and was the first to try… no issues. We eventually worked our way up to two team members hanging simultaneously, reaching a combined load of over 300 lbs. The bridge finally failed when the <strong>wood glue slipped</strong>, not from any buckling or fracture in the structural members.
          
          <br><br>
          
          <strong>After the competition, Professor Vlassak called us aside and told us that he was impressed with our bridge's performance and noted that, had the glue held, it likely would have supported over 300 lbs.</strong> I’m proud of what we built and wish we had some videos of the when we were hanging from the bridge when it failed.
